# Mobile Frontend

This directory contains a lightweight React application built with Vite. It provides a basic mobile-focused UI for students and teachers. Run the following commands to start it in development mode:

```bash
cd mobile-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app currently includes simple placeholder routes for a student and teacher dashboard which can be extended to integrate with the Flask backend APIs.
