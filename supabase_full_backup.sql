From automating code generation to optimizingtesting and deployment, AI is reshaping how software is designed, builtand maintained.AI, particularly generative AI (gen AI) and large language models (LLMs),streamline the development cycle by automating key steps, from ideageneration and requirement gathering to coding and testing. Operating in collaboration with human developers, gen AI transformsideas into requirements. It then converts those requirements into userstories, basic explanations of software features written from theperspective of the end user and generates test cases, code anddocumentation. This collaboration speeds up the development processand improves the quality of the final product.AI has a significant impact on code generation. Machine learning-enabledtools use natural language processing (NLP) to interpret natural languagedescriptions and produce code suggestions or complete code. Thiscapability accelerates coding, reduces human error and allows developersto focus on more complex and creative tasks rather than boilerplate code. \n01/06/25, 19.55AI in Software Development | IBM\nPage 2 of 14https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-developmentAI-powered autocompletion and code synthesis further improveproductivity by predicting the next lines of code or even generating entirefunctions. AI tools adapt and evolve by using machine learning modelsand deep learning techniques, which leads to more efficient codingpractices and project outcomes.Beyond coding, AI technologies enhance debugging and testing.Advanced AI tools can automatically detect bugs, vulnerabilities andinefficiencies and suggest fixes or optimizations. AI-driven testingsystems generate adaptive test cases and prioritize the most critical tests,improving software quality and security. AI helps developers avoid future issues with its ability to predict errorsbased on historical data. These systems rely on sophisticated machinelearning algorithms to continually improve detection and testingmethodologies by analyzing metrics gathered from previous issues.AI assists in project management and DevOps by automating routinetasks, improving time estimates and optimizing continuousintegration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. AI-driven tools helpallocate resources, schedule tasks more efficiently and monitor systemperformance in real time, optimizing deployment and preventing potentialfailures.AI development has also introduced specialized frameworks that allowdevelopers to use programming languages to build more reliable andefficient AI applications.Overall, AI is increasing development speed and accuracy and fostering amore reliable and secure software environment. The future will bring evenmore advancements. As gen AI evolves, it might fundamentally reshapeevery stage of development and might even render agile methodologies,as we know them today, obsolete.\n01/06/25, 19.55AI in Software Development | IBM\nPage 3 of 14https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-developmentHow AI is used in software developmentAI offers tools and techniques that enhance efficiency, creativity and theoverall development process.

This process allows developers toprioritize valuable features and enhancements.What AI means for software engineersAI is fundamentally redefining the role of software engineers anddevelopers, moving them from code implementers to orchestrators oftechnology. By automating routine tasks, AI boosts productivity and freesengineers to focus on higher-level problem-solving, such as architecturalplanning, system integration, strategic decision-making and creativechallenges. This shift is driving greater innovation and efficiency.\n01/06/25, 19.55AI in Software Development | IBM\nPage 9 of 14https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-developmentTools such as generative AI, code completion systems and automatedtesting platforms reduce the need for engineers, developers andprogrammers to manually write code, debug or conduct time-consumingtests. This automation improves efficiency and minimizes human error,leading to cleaner and more optimized code.AI tools can also generate code snippets or entire functions, allowingengineers and developers to oversee AI-driven processes and guide themtoward project goals. Engineers and developers now manage AI’s integration into thedevelopment process. They collaborate closely with AI systems and usetheir expertise to refine AI-generated outputs and make sure they meettechnical requirements. They use APIs and AI-driven tools to create richer,more data-driven applications without needing deep expertise in areassuch as data analysis. As a result, they are more engaged in innovation,system optimization and solving business challenges.Despite concerns that AI might erode fundamental coding skills, manybelieve it is augmenting rather than replacing developers, allowing them tofocus on system optimization and innovation.Though AI will not replace engineers anytime soon, it is clear that itsignificantly alters how they work. Human expertise is still required toguide and refine AI outputs, helping ensure that the technologycomplements rather than disrupts the development process.Who can use AI in software developmentAI in software development is no longer limited to data science expertsand developers. It is becoming increasingly accessible to nontechnicalindividuals as well. Skilled developers and data scientists continue to harness AI's full\n01/06/25, 19.55AI in Software Development | IBM\nPage 10 of 14https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-developmentpotential to build advanced systems, while nontechnical users can nowuse AI through no-code and low-code platforms. These platforms,accessed via application programming interfaces (APIs), offer user-friendly interfaces that enable those with little or no coding experience tocreate apps, automate processes, and implement AI-driven solutions.No-code and low-code platforms democratize software development byallowing users to build AI-powered applications with features such asnatural language processing (NLP), image recognition and predictiveanalytics using simple drag-and-drop tools. This removes the need forextensive coding or machine learning expertise. Nontechnical users, suchas business analysts and product managers, can apply AI to solvebusiness challenges, automate workflows or create experiences such aschatbots and voice assistants. As a result, AI integration is accessible to abroader range of industries and professionals.For users who require more customization but lack the resources to traintheir own models, pretrained foundation models offer a practical solution.These models, trained on vast datasets, can be fine-tuned for specifictasks or industries, allowing users to benefit from machine learningwithout significant investment in computing power or time. Also, cloud-based machine learning platforms provide scalableinfrastructure and prebuilt tools, enabling users to deploy AI at scalewithout the technical burden of developing models from scratch. Theseplatforms simplify AI integration, but still rely on developers and datascientists for more complex or customized software solutions. By bridging the gap between technical and nontechnical users, AI ismaking software development more collaborative and opening newpossibilities for innovation across industries.Benefits of AI in software development\n01/06/25, 19.55AI in Software Development | IBM\nPage 11 of 14https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-developmentThe use of AI in software development offers several key benefits thatenhance productivity, efficiency and the quality of applications.1. Automation of repetitive tasks2. Improved software quality3. Faster decision-making and planning4. Democratization of software development5. Enhanced user experience and personalizationAutomation of repetitive tasks AI-powered tools can assist developers by automatically generating codesnippets or entire functions, which significantly reduce development time.This automation allows developers to focus on higher-level tasks such asproblem-solving and architectural design rather than code generation,bug detection and testing. Improved software qualityAI detects bugs, vulnerabilities and inefficiencies early in the developmentcycle. AI-driven testing tools can generate test cases, prioritize criticaltests and even run tests autonomously. These capabilities speed up thedebugging and testing process and enhance the reliability of the software.Faster decision-making and planningAI can analyze large datasets, project historical trends and provide moreaccurate predictions regarding timelines, resource allocation and featureprioritization. These capabilities lead to better project management andmore efficient use of time and resources.Democratization of software developmentThrough no-code and low-code platforms, nontechnical users can build\n01/06/25, 19.55AI in Software Development | IBM\nPage 12 of 14https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-developmentand customize applications that use AI without needing deepprogramming expertise. These platforms enable business professionals,product managers and other stakeholders to create solutions tailored totheir needs. Enhanced user experience and personalizationAI can personalize applications in real time and offer customizedrecommendations, interfaces and features by analyzing user behavior andpreference. This ability leads to higher user satisfaction and betterengagement, making AI an asset in delivering more intuitive and user-friendly software products.Mitigating the potential risks of AI in softwaredevelopment AI brings significant advantages to software development but it alsopresents potential risks that must be proactively managed. Each risk canbe mitigated through thoughtful strategies, helping ensure that AI isintegrated responsibly.Bias in AI models: If the data used to train AI models contains biases, theAI can perpetuate or even amplify these biases in its outputs. This canlead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in software systems, particularlyin applications that involve decision-making or user interactions.To mitigate this risk, it’s crucial to use diverse, representative andunbiased training data. Regularly auditing AI outputs for fairness andintegrating bias detection tools can also help ensure more equitableoutcomes.Overreliance on AI: Developers can become overly dependent on AI toolsfor coding, debugging or testing, which might lead to a decline in theirfundamental programming skills. This decline might pose a problem when\n01/06/25, 19.55AI in Software Development | IBM\nPage 13 of 14https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-developmentAI tools fail or produce incorrect results. To counter overreliance, developers should use AI as an assistive toolwhile also maintaining and honing their own technical expertise. Ongoingtraining and periodic review of manual coding techniques can helpdevelopers stay sharp.Security vulnerabilities: AI-generated code can introduce securityvulnerabilities if not properly vetted. Although AI can help identify bugs, itmight also create flaws that human developers might overlook. To protect against these vulnerabilities, human oversight should remain acritical component of code review. Security audits, testing and manualinspections of AI-generated code should be conducted to help ensurethat the software remains secure. Implementing automated securitychecks can further reduce vulnerabilities.Lack of transparency: Many AI models, particularly in machine learning,operate in ways that are not entirely transparent to users. This opacitymakes it difficult to understand why AI systems make certain decisions,leading to challenges in debugging, improving or helping ensureaccountability in AI-driven applications.To improve transparency, developers should use more interpretablemodels whenever possible and apply tools that provide insights into thedecision-making processes of AI systems. Clear documentation andtransparency protocols should be in place to enhance accountability.Job displacement: AI aims to augment human work rather than replaceit. Still, the automation of certain tasks might reduce the demand forcertain development roles, leading to potential job displacement.To address displacement, companies should invest in reskilling andupskilling their workforce, helping employees transition to roles that focus\n01/06/25, 19.55AI in Software Development | IBM\nPage 14 of 14https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-developmenton overseeing and collaborating with AI systems.

Scales Complexity“Membantu menangani proyek yang sangat kompleks.”Proyek software modern bisa berisijutaan baris kode. Tanpa pendekatan terstruktur, akan sulit sekali dipahami, dikelola, dan diperbaiki.SE menyediakankerangka proses, metode, dan dokumentasisehingga proyek besar tetap bisa dikembangkan oleh banyak orang dalam tim.\n🧠Contoh nyata:Sistem operasi sepertiWindowsatauAndroidmemiliki lebih dari 50 juta baris kode. Tidak mungkin dikelola tanpa software engineering.\n✅2. Saves Lives and Money“Software yang baik bisa menyelamatkan nyawa dan menghemat biaya besar.”SE digunakan dalamsistem kritisseperti rumah sakit, pesawat, sistem keuangan, hingga transportasi.Kesalahan sekecil apa pun bisa menyebabkankerugian fatal atau nyawa melayang.Proses SE (seperti testing, validasi, risk control) mengurangi risiko ini.\n🧠Contoh nyata:Sistemalat pacu jantung digitalatauautopilot pesawatharus benar-benar bebas error. Tidak bisa hanya mengandalkan coding tanpa standar kualitas.35\nWhy So4ware Engineering Ma;ers•Scales complexity:helps manage millions of lines of code.•Saves lives and money:soKware powers hospitals, planes, banks.•Supports evolu:on:enables conAnuous improvement and adaptability.•Ensures quality:via process, tesAng, and maintenance.\n\n✅3. Supports Evolution“Mendukung perbaikan terus-menerus dan adaptasi terhadap perubahan.”Dunia teknologi terus berubah. Software harus bisa:Di-updateuntuk fitur baruMenyesuaikan hardware baruMemenuhi regulasi terbaruSE menyediakanstruktur modular dan dokumentasiyang membuat pengembangan jangka panjang lebih mudah.\n🧠Contoh nyata:AplikasiGojekatauShopeeterus mengalami perubahan tampilan dan penambahan fitur. Tanpa fondasi SE, setiap update bisa menyebabkan bug besar.\n✅4. Ensures Quality“Menjamin kualitas produk secara keseluruhan.”SE memperkenalkan:Standar dokumentasiTahapan uji cobaReview berkalaPengendalian perubahanSemua ini membantu memastikan softwarestabil, bisa dipercaya, dan sesuai kebutuhan pengguna.\n🧠Contoh nyata:Sebelum software kasir atau aplikasi perbankan diluncurkan, dilakukanuji regresi, pengujian performa, dan validasi keamananagar pelanggan tidak dirugikan.\n35\n36\nSoftware is Everywhere•Embedded in cars, smartphones, home appliances.•CriAcal to AI, entertainment, ﬁnance, healthcare, and infrastructure.•Society depends on soKware more than ever before.\n\n🧩1. Product + VehiclePenjelasan:Software adalah produk itu sendiri (misalnya aplikasi), dan sekaligus kendaraan untuk menyampaikan layanan digital.Analogi:Bayangkansebuah mobil pengantar paket. Mobil itu sendiri adalah produk (dibuat oleh perusahaan), dan juga alat untuk mengantarkan barang ke tujuan.Demikian juga, software sepertiZoomadalah produk yang dibuat, dan sekaligus kendaraan untuk menyampaikan layanan video meeting ke pengguna.\n⚙2. Handles EverythingPenjelasan:Software mengatur berbagai fungsi: pemrosesan data, komunikasi, kendali sistem, dan lain-lain.Analogi:Sepertiotak di dalam robot: software yang mengendalikan kapan robot harus jalan, berbicara, atau mengambil benda.\n📱3. Powers EverythingPenjelasan:Software menggerakkan hampir semua teknologi modern: dari aplikasi HP , IoT di 37\nNature of So4ware•Product + Vehicle: SoKware itself is the product and delivers digital services.•Handles everything from processing to communicaAon to control.•Powers: mobile apps, IoT devices, AI, enterprise systems, more.•SoKware delivers informaAon — and also risks (privacy, security).\n\nrumah, AI, sampai sistem perusahaan besar.Analogi:Layaknyalistrik di rumah, software adalah "tenaga" di balik layar — kamu tidak melihatnya langsung, tapi semua alat jadi bisa berfungsi karena itu.\n⚠4. Delivers Info – and RisksPenjelasan:Software menyampaikan informasi, tapi juga bisa membuka risiko, seperti pelanggaran privasi atau peretasan.Analogi:Sepertijalan rayayang bisa mempercepat pengiriman barang, tapi jika tidak hati-hati, bisa juga menyebabkan kecelakaan.Demikian juga software: berguna, tapi harus dikendalikan dengan keamanan dan tanggung jawab.\n37\n38\nStory: The Game Developer•A dev manages AI funcAonality in a 3M-line codebase for a popular game.•Uses adapted SE pracAces to ensure quality.•Emphasizes need to convert creaAve input into technical requirements.•IteraAve builds, tesAng, and architecture reuse are crucial.\n39\nSo4ware vs Hardware•Hardware wears out physically (bathtub failure curve).•Maintenance is harder due to lack of 'spare parts'.\n•SoKware doesn't wear out but deteriorates due to change.•SoKware evolves and introduces new bugs.\n\nSystem Software: Compilers, OS, drivers.Application Software: Business tools.Embedded Software: Appliances, automotive systems.Engineering/Scientiﬁc: Simulations, CAD, data science.Product-line Software: Reusable software-kits.Web/Mobile Applications: Browsers, cloud, mobile.AI Software: ML, robotics, pattern recognition.\n🧰Contoh Nyata dalam Dunia Software:Microsoft O]ice➜ Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook — semua dibangun di atas fondasi framework yang sama (toolbar, UI engine, spell checker), tapi tiap aplikasi punya fungsinya masing-masing.E-commerce Platform➜ Shopify atau WooCommerce menyediakantemplate toko onlineyang bisa disesuaikan untuk fashion, makanan, atau elektronik — semuanya dibangun darikit software yang sama.Android Custom ROM➜ Sistem operasi berbasis Android seperti MIUI (Xiaomi), OneUI (Samsung), 40\nSo4ware ApplicaHon Domains\n\nOxygenOS (OnePlus) — mereka memakai Android sebagai “core product line” tapi dengan UI dan ﬁtur berbeda.\n40\n41\nLegacy So4ware•Old but essenAal systems (banks, airlines, governments).•OKen poorly documented, high maintenance cost.•Can’t simply throw them away — must evolve carefully.•Reengineering becomes necessary to remain viable.\n42\nIEEE DeﬁniHon of So4ware Engineering"The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software."\nSystema(c→ Harus adaproses yang jelasdari awal sampai akhir.Disciplined→ Harus dilakukan denganketer(ban dan konsistensi, Bdak asal coding.Quan(ﬁable→ Harus bisadiukur(misalnya: waktu, bug, performa, progres).\n•Emphasis onengineering discipline, not just development.•Process must betailoredto the context and team.\n43\n•\n🏗Analogi: Bangun Gedung vs. Bangun SoFwareRekayasa BangunanRekayasa Software (SE)Ada gambar rencana arsitekturAda dokumen desain perangkat lunakAda proses pembangunan bertahapAda proses: komunikasi→ perencanaan→ modeling→ coding → testingAda insinyur & mandor proyekAda software engineer & project managerAda audit & inspeksi kualitasAda QA testing, review, dan validasi\n🟨1. Quality Focus (Fokus pada Kualitas)Ini adalahdasar dari semua lapisan lainnya.Semua hal yang dilakukan dalam proyek software — mulai dari desain, pengkodean, hingga testing — harus diarahkan untuk menghasilkansoftware berkualitas tinggi.Tanpa kualitas sebagai fondasi, software akan mudah rusak, sulit dirawat, dan cepat ditinggalkan pengguna.\n📌Contoh:Penggunaan test-driven development (TDD) dan review code secara rutin untuk menjamin tidak ada error tersembunyi.\n🟧2. Process LayerProses menyediakanstruktur atau kerangka kerjayang mengarahkan seluruh aktivitas pengembangan perangkat lunak.Ini melibatkan tahapan seperti:Komunikasi dengan userPerencanaanPemodelan (modeling)Konstruksi (coding dan testing)Deployment dan pemeliharaan44\nSo4ware Engineering Layers•Quality Focus(foundaAon).•Process Layer– provides structure.•Methods– technical steps: design, tesAng, coding.•Tools– CASE tools, automaAon, integraAon.\n\n📌Contoh:Metodologi sepertiAgile, Scrum, atau Waterfalladalah bagian dari process layer.\n🟩3. MethodsMethod adalah langkah teknis yang dilakukan selama proses rekayasa perangkat lunak.Termasuk aktivitas seperti:Analisis kebutuhanDesain sistemPengujian (testing)Pemrograman (coding)\n📌Contoh:MenggunakanUML diagramuntuk mendesain sistem atau metode pengujian seperti unit test dan black-box test.\n🔵4. ToolsTools adalah perangkat bantu untukmengotomasi, mempercepat, dan menyederhanakanpenerapan metode dan proses.Tools dapat berupa:IDE (seperti Visual Studio Code)CASE tools (Computer-Aided Software Engineering)Alat manajemen versi (Git)Platform integrasi & deployment (CI/CD seperti GitHub Actions)\n📌Contoh:Menggunakan Postman untuk pengujian API atau Figma untuk desain antarmuka.\n44\n✅1. Communication (Komunikasi)\n💬"Ngobrol dulu sebelum mulai bikin."Tim pengembang harus bicara dengan pengguna atau klien.Tujuannya: memahami apa yang dibutuhkan.Tanya: Siapa yang akan pakai? Apa masalahnya? Apa yang diinginkan?\n📌Contoh:Seorang mahasiswa membuat aplikasi untuk kantin kampus, dia wawancara ibu kantin dulu untuk tahu ﬁtur apa yang dibutuhkan (pesanan online, catatan hutang, dsb).\n✅2. Planning (Perencanaan)\n📅"Rencanakan sebelum mulai kerja."Tentukan siapa mengerjakan apa, kapan selesai, dan risiko apa yang bisa terjadi.Alat bantu: jadwal, task list, tools manajemen proyek (misalnya: Trello, Notion).\n📌Contoh:Tim membuat jadwal pengerjaan aplikasi: minggu 1 untuk desain, minggu 2 untuk coding, minggu 3 untuk testing.\n✅3. Modeling (Pemodelan)\n🧩"Gambarkan dulu sistemnya sebelum dikoding."Buat model atau rancangan sistem: bisa berupa ﬂowchart, diagram alur data, 45\nSo4ware Process Frameworkngobrol ➝ rencana ➝ desain ➝ coding ➝ uji ➝ publish.\n\natau desain UI.Mempermudah tim agar punya gambaran yang sama.\n📌Contoh:Sebelum mulai membuat aplikasi, tim menggambar sketsa halaman login, dashboard, dan form input.\n✅4. Construction (Konstruksi)\n👨💻"Saatnya coding dan testing. "Implementasi (coding) dan pengujian dilakukan di sini.Uji coba dilakukan untuk mencari dan memperbaiki bug.\n📌Contoh:Mahasiswa mulai membuat fitur login, lalu mencoba input data palsu untuk memastikan validasi bekerja dengan baik.\n✅5. Deployment (Penerapan/Distribusi)\n📦"Serahkan ke pengguna dan ambil feedback. "Software dipasang di perangkat pengguna atau di-hosting online.Pengguna mencoba, lalu memberi masukan untuk versi berikutnya.\n📌Contoh:Aplikasi kantin diunggah ke Play Store versi beta. Pengguna mencoba dan memberi komentar seperti: “butuh tombol kembali”,  atau “warna terlalu mencolok”.\n🧠 Tips Tambahan untuk Mahasiswa:Gunakan pendekatan ini diprojek akhirataucapstone project.Jangan langsung coding —ikuti alurnya: ngobrol ➝ rencana ➝ desain ➝ coding ➝ uji ➝ publish.\n45\n📘 Penjelasan:SE process is not linear\n👉 Artinya: tidak seperti garis lurus dari A ke Z. Dalam praktiknya, proses rekayasa perangkat lunak bisa kembali ke langkah sebelumnya jika ditemukan masalah atau perubahan kebutuhan.Many projects use iterations\n👉 Proyek biasanya dibagi menjadibeberapa siklus (iterasi). Tiap siklus akan merancang, membangun, dan menguji sebagian sistem.Each iteration delivers an increment of the system\n👉 Setiap iterasi menghasilkan versiyang lebih lengkapdari sistem. Misalnya, versi 1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2, dst.Feedback guides future increments\n👉 Masukan dari pengguna atau penguji digunakan untuk memperbaiki dan menambah ﬁtur di iterasi berikutnya.\n46\nIteraHve and Incremental Development•SE process isnot linear.•Many projects useiterations.•Each iteration delivers anincrementof the system.•Feedback guides future increments.\n\n📘 Penjelasan SederhanaProject Tracking & Control\n🧭 Seperti mengecek Google Maps saat perjalanan. Pastikan proyek masih di jalur dan sesuai rencana.Risk Management\n⚠ Identiﬁkasi potensi hambatan (misal: deadline mepet, tim kurang pengalaman) dan siapkan solusinya.Quality Assurance\n🔍 Seperti kontrol kualitas produk. Pastikan hasil akhir memenuhi standar.Technical Reviews\n👓 Tinjauan kode atau desain sejak awal agar kesalahan tidak terlambat ditemukan.Measurement\n📏 Ukur performa: berapa bug ditemukan? Berapa lama tiap ﬁtur selesai?Conﬁguration Management\n🔄 Kelola perubahan agar tidak merusak versi yang sudah ada. Misal: Git untuk version control.Reusability Management\n🧩 Buat komponen (kode/fungsi) yang bisa dipakai ulang, hemat waktu untuk 47\nUmbrella Activities in SE•Project Tracking & Control: Ensure alignment with plan.•Risk Management: Identify and address project risks.•Quality Assurance: Maintain quality through defined activities.•Technical Reviews: Early error detection and correction.•Measurement: Evaluate process and product effectiveness.•Configuration Management: Handle change systematically.•Reusability Management: Promote and manage reusable components.•Work Product Preparation: Ensure comprehensive documentation.\nproyek berikutnya.Work Product Preparation\n📄 Siapkan dokumentasi lengkap: panduan pengguna, spesiﬁkasi sistem, dll.\n47\n🧠Inti Konsep:Proses rekayasa perangkat lunakbukanlah aturan kaku.Harusbisa disesuaikanagar cocok dengan:Proyek kecil atau besarTim yang berpengalaman atau masih belajarKebutuhan industri yang berbeda-beda\n✅Contoh Penyesuaian (Adaptation Depends On):\n📦 Project SizeProyek besar (ERP , sistem nasional): butuh proses lengkap, dokumentasi lengkap.Proyek kecil (web toko online sederhana): bisa cukup dengan proses ringan seperti agile.\n👨💻 Team SkillTim senior: bisa gunakan proses yang lebih ﬂeksibel.Tim pemula: butuh panduan lebih ketat agar tidak bingung.\n🏭 Domain RequirementsMedis, penerbangan: butuh validasi ketat, proses formal.Startup aplikasi makanan: bisa lebih cepat dan ﬂeksibel.\n🤝 Stakeholder Involvement48\nProcess Adaptation•Process isn't rigid.•It adapts to:•Project size•Team skill•Domain requirements•Stakeholder involvement•OrganizaAonal culture\n\nJika klien aktif terlibat: cocok dengan pendekatan iteratif seperti Scrum.Jika klien pasif: perlu proses yang lebih terstruktur sejak awal.\n🏢 Organizational CulturePerusahaan birokratis: suka proses formal seperti Waterfall.Perusahaan startup: suka metode ringan seperti Lean atau Agile.\n48\n🧠Essence of Software Engineering PracticeInti praktik SE = cara berpikir seperti problem solver\n✅1. Understand the Problem (Pahami masalahnya dulu)“Jangan langsung coding sebelum ngerti masalahnya.”Tanyakan: Apa yang dibutuhkan pengguna?Siapa yang terlibat? Apa yang belum diketahui?\n📌Contoh:Sebelum membuat sistem presensi, tanyakan dulu: Apakah mahasiswa bisa login lewat HP? Apakah perlu GPS?\n✅2. Plan a Solution (Rancang Solusinya)“Pecah masalah jadi bagian kecil. Cari pola yang bisa dipakai ulang.”Buat alur solusi, pilih teknologi, pecah ke sub-task.\n📌Contoh:Sistem absensi bisa dipecah jadi: login, input lokasi, validasi waktu, simpan ke database.\n✅3. Carry Out the Plan (Laksanakan rencananya)“Mulai coding sesuai desain, jangan loncat-loncat.”Ikuti alur desain yang sudah dirancang.Gunakan prinsip traceability: desain → kode → hasil.49\nEssence of Software Engineering Practice•Understand the Problem: IdenAfy stakeholders, requirements, unknowns.•Plan a SoluAon: Find reusable pa^erns, break down into subproblems.•Carry Out the Plan: Follow design roadmap, trace implementaAon.•Examine the Result: Apply tesAng and validaAon."Ngana mo bikin aplikasi jang langsung koding, musti ngerti dolo masalahnya, rancang bae, jalankan sesuai rencana, terus periksa ulang—karena software bagus itu lahir dari proses, bukan dari buru-buru!"\n📌Contoh:Kalau kamu sudah buat sketsa UI dan database relasi, ikuti urutannya saat implementasi.\n✅4. Examine the Result (Periksa hasilnya)“Cek: Apakah hasilnya sesuai yang diinginkan?”Uji dengan skenario nyata.Validasi output, cek bug, evaluasi kembali desain.\n📌Contoh:Coba login dari HP lain, cek apakah waktu dan lokasi absensi benar tercatat.\n49\nProvide Value – Every feature must add user value\n✅Example:In a food delivery app, adding a“Track My Order”feature provides real-time updates and transparency — directly enhancing user experience.\n❌Anti-example:Adding a ﬂashy animation every time the user switches tabs may look good but adds no real value and slows down performance.2. Keep it Simple (KISS) – Elegant, not overdesigned\n✅Example:Instead of building a custom calendar widget, a developer integrates Google Calendar API for scheduling. It works well and is easy to maintain.\n❌Anti-example:A startup builds a full custom time-tracking module with 50+ unused options, making it hard for users and developers alike.3. Maintain the Vision – Protect system integrity\n✅Example:In a banking app, all teams follow a shared architecture guideline that enforcesconsistent encryption and audit logging.\n❌Anti-example:50\nHooker’s Principles of So1ware Engineering•Provide Value– Every feature must add user value.•Keep it Simple (KISS)– Elegant, not overdesigned.•Maintain the Vision– Protect system integrity.•Design for Others– Think of maintainers, users.•Be Future-Ready– Plan for changes.•Plan for Reuse– Don’t reinvent the wheel.•Think!– Good design begins with good thinking."Bikin bagus, jang ribet, musti pikir panjang, for torang pe masa depan!"(Make it good, don’t make it complicated, think ahead—for our future!)\nDevelopers bypass the architecture and hardcode database access, compromising data security and scalability.4. Design for Others – Think of maintainers, users\n✅Example:A developer writes clear code with comments and meaningful variable names, uses REST API conventions, and provides a README for future teams.\n❌Anti-example:Functions namedx1()andx2()with 1000+ lines of undocumented code — future developers waste hours trying to understand it.5. Be Future-Ready – Plan for changes\n✅Example:Instead of hardcoding currency types, the e-commerce app uses a conﬁg ﬁle to add/remove currencies dynamically.\n❌Anti-example:Hardcoded business logic assumes only USD payments — breaks when international expansion happens.6. Plan for Reuse – Don’t reinvent the wheel\n✅Example:An authentication module is designed as a separate reusable service, which can be used across mobile, web, and internal tools.\n❌Anti-example:Each product team writes their own login ﬂow with dilerent standards and bugs — duplicated elort and inconsistency.\n50\n51\nChapter Summary•Software à everywhere, critical, evolving.•SE àstructure, discipline, engineering mindset.•Process framework: 5 core + umbrella activities.•Legacy and AI software need different considerations.•Good SE practice prevents failure and promotes growth.\nFacebook algorithm amplifying misinformation: Designed to promote engagement, but ended up fueling echo chambers and spreading false news.Flash crashes in stock markets: Caused by automated trading algorithms acting on rapid data ﬂuctuations without human oversight.Facial recognition bias: AI systems misidentifying people of color due to non-diverse training data.Autopilot errors in self-driving cars: Causing accidents in complex real-world scenarios that were not anticipated in training.Google Maps rerouting tra]ic through neighborhoods: Increasing congestion and safety risks in quiet areas.Positively:Increased productivity: Automation in business, ﬁnance, education, and healthcare.Global communication: Instant messaging, video calls, and remote collaboration.Access to knowledge: Platforms like Google, Wikipedia, and YouTube empower self-learning.52\nReﬂecHon & Discussion QuesHons•What are examples of unintended consequences of software?•How has software changed society — positively and negatively?•How would you ensure software doesn’t deteriorate?•Should the same SE process be used for all domains?•What risks emerge when software fails in critical systems?\nHealthcare advancement: Software in diagnostics, robotics surgery, and patient monitoring.Negatively:Digital addiction: Social media and games designed for endless engagement.Privacy invasion: Mass data collection and surveillance.Job displacement: Automation replacing repetitive manual jobs.Cybercrime: Hacking, ransomware, and phishing threats are rising.No, the same software engineering process should not be rigidly used for all domains.Why?Di]erent domains have di]erent needs:Medical software: Requires rigorous veriﬁcation, validation, and compliance (e.g., ISO 13485, FDA).Games: Agile and creative iterations, speed > formality.Banking: Strong security, fault-tolerance, and audit trails.Embedded systems: Must meet hardware constraints and real-time performance.Conclusion: Theframework activities stay the same, but theirimplementation must be tailored(as Pressman notes: SE must be adaptable and agile).\n52	20250603_095733_Introduction_to_Software_Engineering.pdf	pdf	2025-06-03 01:57:35.298439

All Rights Reserved.The Role of Informa.on Systems\nAsk managers to describe their most important resources and they’ll list money, equipment, materials, and people—not necessarily in that order. It’s very unusual for managers to consider information an important resource, and yet it is. As electronic business and electronic commerce grow in popularity and more firms digitize their operations, having useful information is becoming even more important to the global business community\n4\nCopyright © 2022, 2020, 2018 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights ReservedHow IS Transforming Business? •Global spending on informa1on technology (IT) and IT services: nearly $3.8 trillion in 2019; $160 billion spent on management consul1ng and services•Organiza1onal, management, and cultural changes are oJen required for ﬁrms to derive full business value from IT investments\nFigure 1.1, Page 6.Information technology capital investment, defined as IT equipment, software, and research and development (R & D) spending, amounted to over 40 percent of total US capital spending (in nominal GDP) between 1999 and 2019. Source: US Bureau of Economic Analysis.You could ask students why they think the percentage of total investment devoted to IT has amounted to over 40 percent of total U.S. capital spending each year from 1998 to 2019. Other kinds of capital investment are machinery and buildings.  Why would firms continue to spend so much on IT investment? Part of the answer is capital substitution: the price of IT capital has been falling exponentially, whereas the price of machine and buildings has been growing at slightly more than the rate of inflation. Wherever possible, firms would much rather invest in more IT than machinery or buildings because the returns on the investment are greater.Alt TextLong description: A line graph shows the IT equipment, software, and R&D spending in nominal GDP over the years. The details of the graph are as follows:•The x-axis shows the year from 1998 to 2019 in increments of 1. •The y-axis shows the percent of spending as a percent of total capital spending in nominal GDP, ranging from 5 to 100 in increments of 5. •The graph shows that the curve starts at about 41 percent in 1998 and remains between 40 and 45 percent till around 2008. It then peaks to about 50 percent between 2009 and 2010 and then dropped. It was last recorded at 46.8 percent in 2019. 5\nCopyright © 2022, 2020, 2018 Pearson Education, Inc.

Suddenly, students should see that information systems play a central role mediating and interacting with all these players. Hence, systems play a key role in the operations and survival of the firm.

You could also ask students if they could imagine any reason to create an information system besides profitability or strategic positioning (it’s not likely that they will think of one, which will prove the point). One reason to create a system that is not primarily profit-oriented is to meet the information reporting requirements of government and other authorities.

All Rights ReservedFigure 1.7 The Business Informa=on Value Chain\n\nThe example used in the book for complementary assets is for automobile companies: these companies rely on investments in highways, other roads, gas stations, repair facilities, and so on to maximize the value of their primary investment. Ask students to provide a different example of another company’s or industries complementary assets.\n42\nCopyright © 2022, 2020, 2018 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights ReservedComplementary Assets: Organiza/onal Capital and the Right Business Model•Assets required to derive value from a primary investment•Firms suppor1ng technology investments with investment in complementary assets receive superior returns•Example: Invest in technology and the people to make it work properly\nEmphasize that firms that make significant investment in complementary assets tend to derive greater benefit from information technology investment than those that do not. Consideration of complementary assets should be a part of any firm’s broader view of how to create and implement their information systems. Stress to students that managers must consider dimensions such as complementary assets in order to derive benefit from information systems and be successful.\n43\nCopyright © 2022, 2020, 2018 Pearson Education, Inc.

Why do they feel this way? Emphasize that the technical approach does not ignore behavior and the behavioral approach does not ignore technology, but that they are indeed two distinct approaches.Alt TextLong description: A circular figure shows the technical approaches and behavioral approaches to MIS.

berbagai konteks proyek untuk menyesuaikan kegiatan proses secara fleksibel.•Menganalisis studi kasusuntuk memahami pertimbangan nyata dalam memilih model proses.•Merefleksikan pentingnya keseimbangan antara proses dan produkdalam pengembangan perangkat lunak berkualitas.\nTopics•What is a Software Process•Generic Process Model•Task Sets•Prescriptive Models (Waterfall, Prototyping, Spiral, Unified)•Process Flows•Selecting the Right Model•Case Study•Comparative Analysis\nWhat is a Software Process?•A software process is a framework of activities, actions, and tasks to build high-quality software.•Benefits?•Guides project activities•Ensures quality & timeliness•Involves all stakeholders\n\nWhy Do We Need a Process?•Without a process, development becomes chaotic.Benefits?•Predictability•Repeatability•Quality assurance•Progress tracking\n\nWho is Involved?•Software Engineers•Adapt and follow the process•Stakeholders•Participate in defining and validating the product\n\nFramework and Umbrella AcEviEes•Framework: Communication, Planning, Modeling, Construction, Deployment•Umbrella: Risk Management, QA, Configuration Management, Technical Reviews\n\nTask Sets & Work Products•Task Set includes:•Work tasks•Work products•Quality assurance points•Project milestones•Tailored for each action (e.g., elicitation, design, coding)\n\nWork Product Examples•Source Code•Design Documents•Requirement Specs•Test Cases•User Manuals\n\nUnderstanding Process Flows•Linear•Iterative•Evolutionary•Parallel\n\nProcess Flow\nSequential steps: Communication → Planning → Modeling → Construction → DeploymentSuitable for: Stable, well-understood projects\nProcess Flow\nIterative Flow: Repeat certain activities as needed before proceeding.Good for: Projects with evolving understanding\nProcess Flow\nProgressively build more complete versions in cycles.Used when: Requirements are vague or dynamic\nProcess Flow\nDifferent components handled in parallel.Good for: multi-team, modular projects\nDeﬁning AcEviEes in PracEce•Activities need to be adapted to:•Project complexity•Team size and skill•Stakeholder involvement\n\nExample: Communication Activity•For small project:•Call stakeholder•Note requirements•Send summary for review•For large project:•Inception, Elicitation, Elaboration, etc.\n\n\nTask Set: Small vs. Large Project•Small: •stakeholder meeting •list features•finalize•Large: •multiple interviews•scenario analysis\n\nAssessing the Process•Use metrics to assess progress•Analyze quality, timeliness, risks•Continuous process improvement needed\n\nPrescripEve Models Overview•Predefined structure and order:•Waterfall•Prototyping•Spiral•Unified ProcessEach has defined flows, activities, tasks\nWaterfall ModelLinear sequence of phases•Pros:✓ Simple✓ Clear stages•Cons:✗ Rigid✗ Late testing✗ Assumes clear requirements\n\n•Real projects rarely follow the sequential work flow that the model proposes.•It is often difficult for the customer to state all requirements explicitly at the beginning of most projects.•The customer must have patience because a working version of the program(s) will not be available until late in the project time span.•Major blunders may not be detected until the working program is reviewed.\nPrototyping ModelBuild prototype quickly•Get feedback•IteratePros:✓ Fast validation✓ User involvementCons:✗ Scope creep✗ Quality compromise riska customer defines a set of general objectives for software but does not identify detailed requirements for functions and features\n\nPrototyping: Use Case•UI/UX testing•Customer-facing apps with vague specs\nSpiral ModelCombines prototyping + risk assessment•Iterative and

Lapisan-lapisan ini adalah: Quality Focus, Process, Methods, dan Tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuality Focus merupakan fondasi utama dari seluruh proses rekayasa perangkat lunak. Fokus pada kualitas memastikan bahwa perangkat lunak tidak hanya bekerja secara fungsional, tetapi juga dapat diandalkan, aman, dan mudah dipelihara. Tanpa perhatian pada kualitas, hasil akhirnya bisa membahayakan pengguna atau menyebabkan kerugian besar. Misalnya, dalam pengembangan sistem AI untuk saran tugas mingguan, kualitas hasil sangat ditentukan oleh bagaimana fitur seperti akurasi prediksi dan keamanan data pengguna dijaga sejak awal.\\r\\n\\r\\nLapisan kedua adalah Process, yaitu kerangka kerja yang mengatur bagaimana proyek perangkat lunak dijalankan. Proses ini mencakup aktivitas seperti komunikasi, perencanaan, pemodelan, konstruksi, dan penyebaran. Proses ini membantu tim untuk tetap terorganisir, terstruktur, dan memiliki alur kerja yang jelas. Misalnya, dalam proyek To-Do List AI yang disebutkan di file, proses Agile digunakan untuk berkolaborasi secara efisien antara manusia dan AI melalui iterasi yang cepat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods adalah pendekatan teknis untuk melakukan aktivitas-aktivitas seperti analisis kebutuhan, desain, pengkodean, dan pengujian. Metode ini memberi panduan langkah demi langkah dalam menyelesaikan pekerjaan teknis secara profesional. Contohnya, metode user stories digunakan untuk mengubah kebutuhan pengguna menjadi fitur terstruktur, seperti: \\u201cSebagai pengguna, saya ingin bisa menandai tugas sebagai selesai agar dapat memantau progres harian.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTerakhir, Tools berfungsi untuk mengotomatisasi dan menyederhanakan metode dan proses. Tools seperti Git digunakan untuk version control, Replit dan VS Code untuk pengembangan kode, serta Figma untuk desain UI. Tools ini memastikan efisiensi kerja dan kolaborasi, khususnya dalam pengembangan kolaboratif Human\\u2013AI.\\r\\n\\r\\nDengan kombinasi keempat lapisan ini, pengembangan perangkat lunak menjadi lebih terstruktur, dapat diprediksi, dan tidak lagi hanya mengandalkan \\"asal coding\\", melainkan pendekatan sistematis yang menghasilkan produk berkualitas.", "Software Engineering sangat penting karena memberikan pendekatan sistematis untuk membangun perangkat lunak yang kompleks, aman, dan dapat diandalkan.

Tanpa struktur dan standar yang tepat, proyek besar akan mudah kehilangan arah dan sulit dipelihara. Misalnya, dalam file Anda disebutkan bahwa AI kini membantu mengelola seluruh siklus pengembangan, dari ideasi hingga deployment \\u2014 ini tidak akan mungkin dilakukan secara efisien tanpa pendekatan rekayasa yang baik.\\r\\n\\r\\nKedua, Software Engineering menyelamatkan nyawa dan menghemat biaya, terutama dalam sistem kritis seperti autopilot pesawat atau alat pacu jantung digital. Kesalahan kecil dalam kode dapat menyebabkan bencana besar. Melalui pengujian otomatis dan debugging berbasis AI, risiko ini dapat ditekan secara signifikan.\\r\\n\\r\\nKetiga, Software Engineering mendukung evolusi dan adaptasi, seperti yang dilakukan oleh aplikasi Gojek atau Shopee. Fitur dan kebutuhan pengguna berubah dengan cepat, dan hanya pendekatan rekayasa yang fleksibel dan terstandarisasi yang bisa mengakomodasi perubahan ini tanpa mengorbankan stabilitas sistem.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerakhir, Software Engineering menjamin kualitas dan keandalan melalui penerapan standar, proses pengujian, serta review kode secara sistematis. Sebagai contoh, pada sistem kasir atau aplikasi perbankan, stabilitas dan keamanan mutlak diperlukan.

Masing-masing aktivitas ini berperan penting dalam menjamin keberhasilan proyek perangkat lunak secara terstruktur.\\r\\n\\r\\nKomunikasi adalah langkah pertama di mana kebutuhan dan harapan pengguna digali secara menyeluruh. Misalnya, dalam proyek To-Do List AI, komunikasi dilakukan untuk mengetahui fitur apa saja yang diinginkan pengguna, seperti pengingat mingguan atau kategorisasi tugas.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerencanaan melibatkan penjadwalan aktivitas, pembagian tugas, serta analisis risiko. Dalam file yang Anda kirim, disebutkan bahwa penggunaan tools seperti Git dan CI/CD mendukung proses ini dengan memungkinkan kolaborasi dan versioning yang terencana dengan baik.\\r\\n\\r\\nPemodelan adalah pembuatan representasi sistem, baik dari sisi data maupun arsitektur. Contohnya adalah penggunaan user stories dan wireframe desain UI menggunakan Figma. Pemodelan ini sangat penting agar developer tidak langsung menulis kode tanpa gambaran struktur sistem.\\r\\n\\r\\nKonstruksi mencakup implementasi dan pengujian perangkat lunak. Ini adalah tahap ketika kode ditulis (misalnya di VS Code atau Replit), lalu diuji menggunakan test case yang dihasilkan dari user stories. Dengan bantuan AI, debugging bisa dilakukan otomatis, meningkatkan efisiensi.\\r\\n\\r\\nPenyebaran adalah pengiriman perangkat lunak kepada pengguna. Dalam konteks proyek yang dibahas, aplikasi bisa diunggah ke Play Store versi beta dan feedback pengguna dikumpulkan untuk iterasi berikutnya.

Tanpa perhatian pada kualitas, hasil akhirnya bisa membahayakan pengguna atau menyebabkan kerugian besar. Misalnya, dalam pengembangan sistem AI untuk saran tugas mingguan, kualitas hasil sangat ditentukan oleh bagaimana fitur seperti akurasi prediksi dan keamanan data pengguna dijaga sejak awal.\\r\\n\\r\\nLapisan kedua adalah Process, yaitu kerangka kerja yang mengatur bagaimana proyek perangkat lunak dijalankan. Proses ini mencakup aktivitas seperti komunikasi, perencanaan, pemodelan, konstruksi, dan penyebaran. Proses ini membantu tim untuk tetap terorganisir, terstruktur, dan memiliki alur kerja yang jelas. Misalnya, dalam proyek To-Do List AI yang disebutkan di file, proses Agile digunakan untuk berkolaborasi secara efisien antara manusia dan AI melalui iterasi yang cepat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods adalah pendekatan teknis untuk melakukan aktivitas-aktivitas seperti analisis kebutuhan, desain, pengkodean, dan pengujian. Metode ini memberi panduan langkah demi langkah dalam menyelesaikan pekerjaan teknis secara profesional. Contohnya, metode user stories digunakan untuk mengubah kebutuhan pengguna menjadi fitur terstruktur, seperti: \\u201cSebagai pengguna, saya ingin bisa menandai tugas sebagai selesai agar dapat memantau progres harian.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTerakhir, Tools berfungsi untuk mengotomatisasi dan menyederhanakan metode dan proses. Tools seperti Git digunakan untuk version control, Replit dan VS Code untuk pengembangan kode, serta Figma untuk desain UI. Tools ini memastikan efisiensi kerja dan kolaborasi, khususnya dalam pengembangan kolaboratif Human\\u2013AI.\\r\\n\\r\\nDengan kombinasi keempat lapisan ini, pengembangan perangkat lunak menjadi lebih terstruktur, dapat diprediksi, dan tidak lagi hanya mengandalkan \\"asal coding\\", melainkan pendekatan sistematis yang menghasilkan produk berkualitas."}, {"question_index": 1, "score": 70, "feedback": "Answer received. Consider providing more detailed analysis based on course materials.", "user_answer": "Software Engineering sangat penting karena memberikan pendekatan sistematis untuk membangun perangkat lunak yang kompleks, aman, dan dapat diandalkan. Tanpa pendekatan ini, pengembangan perangkat lunak akan rentan terhadap kegagalan, pemborosan, dan risiko besar bagi pengguna.\\r\\n\\r\\nPertama, Software Engineering mampu mengelola kompleksitas proyek besar, seperti sistem operasi Android atau Windows, yang masing-masing memiliki jutaan baris kode. Tanpa struktur dan standar yang tepat, proyek besar akan mudah kehilangan arah dan sulit dipelihara. Misalnya, dalam file Anda disebutkan bahwa AI kini membantu mengelola seluruh siklus pengembangan, dari ideasi hingga deployment \\u2014 ini tidak akan mungkin dilakukan secara efisien tanpa pendekatan rekayasa yang baik.\\r\\n\\r\\nKedua, Software Engineering menyelamatkan nyawa dan menghemat biaya, terutama dalam sistem kritis seperti autopilot pesawat atau alat pacu jantung digital. Kesalahan kecil dalam kode dapat menyebabkan bencana besar. Melalui pengujian otomatis dan debugging berbasis AI, risiko ini dapat ditekan secara signifikan.\\r\\n\\r\\nKetiga, Software Engineering mendukung evolusi dan adaptasi, seperti yang dilakukan oleh aplikasi Gojek atau Shopee. Fitur dan kebutuhan pengguna berubah dengan cepat, dan hanya pendekatan rekayasa yang fleksibel dan terstandarisasi yang bisa mengakomodasi perubahan ini tanpa mengorbankan stabilitas sistem.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerakhir, Software Engineering menjamin kualitas dan keandalan melalui penerapan standar, proses pengujian, serta review kode secara sistematis. Sebagai contoh, pada sistem kasir atau aplikasi perbankan, stabilitas dan keamanan mutlak diperlukan.

Masing-masing aktivitas ini berperan penting dalam menjamin keberhasilan proyek perangkat lunak secara terstruktur.\\r\\n\\r\\nKomunikasi adalah langkah pertama di mana kebutuhan dan harapan pengguna digali secara menyeluruh. Misalnya, dalam proyek To-Do List AI, komunikasi dilakukan untuk mengetahui fitur apa saja yang diinginkan pengguna, seperti pengingat mingguan atau kategorisasi tugas.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerencanaan melibatkan penjadwalan aktivitas, pembagian tugas, serta analisis risiko. Dalam file yang Anda kirim, disebutkan bahwa penggunaan tools seperti Git dan CI/CD mendukung proses ini dengan memungkinkan kolaborasi dan versioning yang terencana dengan baik.\\r\\n\\r\\nPemodelan adalah pembuatan representasi sistem, baik dari sisi data maupun arsitektur. Contohnya adalah penggunaan user stories dan wireframe desain UI menggunakan Figma. Pemodelan ini sangat penting agar developer tidak langsung menulis kode tanpa gambaran struktur sistem.\\r\\n\\r\\nKonstruksi mencakup implementasi dan pengujian perangkat lunak. Ini adalah tahap ketika kode ditulis (misalnya di VS Code atau Replit), lalu diuji menggunakan test case yang dihasilkan dari user stories. Dengan bantuan AI, debugging bisa dilakukan otomatis, meningkatkan efisiensi.\\r\\n\\r\\nPenyebaran adalah pengiriman perangkat lunak kepada pengguna. Dalam konteks proyek yang dibahas, aplikasi bisa diunggah ke Play Store versi beta dan feedback pengguna dikumpulkan untuk iterasi berikutnya.

Memahami dan menerapkan prinsip-prinsip ini membantu tim pengembangan menghindari perangkap umum dan membangun solusi yang benar-benar bernilai.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrinsip pertama adalah Berikan Nilai (The Reason It All Exists). Prinsip ini menekankan bahwa setiap fitur atau elemen perangkat lunak harus memberikan nilai nyata kepada pengguna. Perangkat lunak ada untuk menyelesaikan masalah atau memenuhi kebutuhan, dan setiap keputusan harus berlandaskan pada tujuan tersebut. Contoh positif adalah sebuah aplikasi e-commerce yang hanya menambahkan fitur pembayaran yang aman dan cepat, yang secara langsung meningkatkan pengalaman pengguna. Anti-contohnya adalah menambahkan fitur media sosial yang tidak relevan ke aplikasi perbankan, yang hanya menambah kompleksitas tanpa memberikan nilai tambah yang jelas kepada pengguna.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrinsip kedua adalah Jaga Kesederhanaan (Keep It Simple, Stupid - KISS). Prinsip ini menganjurkan desain yang elegan dan tidak berlebihan. Tujuannya adalah untuk menciptakan sistem yang mudah dipahami, diimplementasikan, dan dipelihara. Contoh positif adalah API yang dirancang dengan jumlah parameter minimal dan fungsionalitas yang jelas untuk setiap endpoint, memudahkan pengembang lain menggunakannya. Anti-contohnya adalah sistem dengan banyak lapisan abstraksi yang tidak perlu, variabel dengan nama yang ambigu, atau logika bisnis yang tersebar di banyak tempat, menyebabkan kesulitan dalam pemecahan masalah dan pemeliharaan di kemudian hari.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrinsip ketiga yang penting adalah Mendesain untuk Orang Lain (What You Produce, Others Will Consume).
